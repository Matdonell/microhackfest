A function app hosts the execution of your functions in Azure. Follow these steps to create a function app with the new function. The function app is created with a default configuration. For an example of how to explicitly create your function app, see [the other Azure Functions quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function-azure-portal) tutorial.

1. Go to the [Azure Functions portal](https://functions.azure.com/signin?correlationId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) and sign-in with your Azure account.
