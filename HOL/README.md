# Microservices, Serverless and Containers Hackfest HOLs

In these labs you will be introduced to how to build Microservices Applications using Serverless and Containers technology. Specifically Azure Web App for Containers, Azure Functions and Azure Container Service w/Kubernetes.

#### [Lab 1 - Setup](01_Setup)
##### Setting up your environment for the Labs

In this lab you will find the prerequisites and steps to help you set up your computer. After completing the lab you will have a working environment ready for the other labs.

#### [Lab 2 - Creating a trial Microsoft Azure account and activating MSDN benefits](02_CreatingAzureAccount)

In this lab you will create a free Microsoft Azure trial account and activate the MSDN subscription benefits in your Azure account.

#### [Lab 3 - Web App for Containers](03_WebAppContainers)

In this lab you will learn about Azure Web App for Containers which is almost the easiest way to get started with Containers in Azure.

#### [Lab 4 - Containerization ("Dockerize an App")](04_Docker)

In this lab you will learn the basics of Docker and how to take an existing application and ``Dockerize`` it. This is the basic building block of using Containerization to build New Applications or Lift & Shift existing applications.

#### [Lab 5 - Orchestration in Azure with Kubernetes](05_Orchestrator)

In this lab you will learn the basics of Container Orchestrators with a deeper dieve on the basics of Kubernetes (K8s). You will create a Kubernetes Cluster using Azure Container Service (ACS) or ACS Managed Kubernetes (AKS) and learn how to deploy services via a K8s Manifest File.

#### [Lab 6 - Serverless with Cognitive Services](06_Serverless)

In this lab you will learn why Serverless is all the rage when it comes to Application Innovation and why integrating it with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the key to building Intelligent Applications.
